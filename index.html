        <h3> The beginning of AI </h3>
        <br>
        <p>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in the mid-1900s, led by people like Alan Turing. A big meeting called the Dartmouth Conference happened in 1956, marking the start. They made early AI programs to think and solve problems. Even though there were tough times called "AI winters," the field kept growing in the 2000s. They got better at machine learning and deep learning, which led to all the different AI stuff we have now. </p>

                      <h3> How does AI work </h3>
                      <br>
                          <p>  AI works by using special rules to understand information, like how people do. There are three main parts: putting in data, teaching, and using what it's learned. At first, it looks at lots of information to learn how things relate. It adjusts itself to be more accurate. After learning, it can figure things out or make choices based on new information. It doesn't need humans to tell it what to do each time.

                      <br>
                          <p>  
                            AI helps people with disabilities by providing tools like screen readers and speech recognition, making it easier to use computers and communicate online. It also assists with personalized learning, self-driving cars, health tracking, and mental health support, promoting independence and well-being. Virtual and augmented reality aid in therapy and skill-building exercises, showcasing AI's impact on enhancing the lives of people with disabilities.</p>

                      <br>
                          <p>  In the future, AI will improve in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, language understanding, education, climate change, creativity, automation, ethics, governance, and AR/VR. These advancements will transform disease diagnosis, self-driving tech, language comprehension, teaching methods, climate predictions, creativity, industrial processes, ethical standards, and immersive experiences. We'll need to discuss responsible AI use and international cooperation. </p>
