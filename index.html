      <h3>The beginning of AI</h3>
      <p>
        The birth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the mid-20th century,
        spearheaded by figures like Alan Turing and marked by the Dartmouth
        Conference in 1956, led to the development of early AI programs for
        reasoning and problem-solving. Despite setbacks, including "AI winters,"
        the field surged forward in the 21st century with advancements in
        machine learning and deep learning, resulting in a diverse array of AI
        applications we see today

      <h3>How does AI work</h3>
      <p>
        AI functions by processing data through algorithms to mimic human-like
        intelligence. It involves three main steps: data input, training, and
        inference. Initially, large datasets are fed into the system, which
        learns patterns and relationships during a training phase, adjusting
        parameters for accuracy. Once trained, the AI model can make predictions
        or decisions based on new data, without requiring explicit human
        programming for each task

      <h3>AI helps with disablities</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowers individuals with disabilities
        through assistive technologies like screen readers and speech
        recognition, facilitating access to digital content and communication.
        AI also supports personalized learning, autonomous transportation,
        healthcare monitoring, and mental health assistance, promoting
        independence and well-being. Augmented and virtual reality technologies
        enhance rehabilitation and skill-building exercises, demonstrating AI's
        broad impact on improving the lives of people with disabilities

      <h3>AI - what's next?</h3>
      The future of AI encompasses advancements in healthcare, autonomous
      vehicles, NLP, ethics, education, climate change, creativity, automation,
      governance, and AR/VR. These developments will revolutionize disease
      diagnosis, self-driving technology, language understanding, educational
      tutoring, climate modeling, creativity, industrial automation, ethical
      regulation, and immersive experiences, necessitating discussions around
      responsible integration and international collaboration
